# Example code for using the Social Connectedness Index

A set of scripts and shapefiles created to make use of the Social Connectedness Index, constructed from Facebook friendship links. Files are downloadable at: <https://data.humdata.org/organization/facebook>.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This repository uses [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for versioning large files. You will need it installed to clone the repository.

## Main Folders

The scripts are split into 3 main directories:

1. `example_scripts` is a set of example scripts in R that map the SCI data.
2. `gadm_based_shapefiles` is a set of shapefiles (in .shp format and, for R users, in .Rds format), built from the shapefiles for GADM version 2.8 and European NUTS 2016 (see sources below). These can be matched to the Social Connectedness Data for mapping.
3. `covid19_exploration` is a set of example scripts in R and Stata that produce the results in [Kuchler, Russel, and Stroebel 2020](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jstroebe/PDF/SCI_and_COVID.pdf).
